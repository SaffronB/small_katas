1. Aging Friends:
Write a function to tell me which of my friend’s is the oldest?

Xola is 23, Peter is 18, Oya is 29, Ellie is 20, Sive is 27

By the way which of me friends are younger than Ellie?

Other friends said they will send you their list of friends as well… so make sure you function will work for that too.

2. TRAFFIC LIGHT DASH!

Write a function that can answer this questions by parsing this string:

There are 9 traffic lights on my way to work. On my way in 3 were red, 2 were green.

How many lights were orange?

Make sure this function work for other journeys too!

3. WORDS AND NUMBERS
* that can find all the numbers in a sentence;
* that find all words shorter than 3 in a sentence;
* that can find all the numbers in a sentence bigger than 15;
* that count all the words in a sentence;
* that count all numbers in a sentence.
Use this sentence to test:

But use other sentences to test it as well.
